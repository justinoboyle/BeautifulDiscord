MyDiscord
================

**This project isn't maintained, and hasn't been in a while. If you want, you can submit a PR and I'll review it, but I'm not making any changes myself.**

Simple Python script that adds CSS hot-reload and Custom JavaScript support to Discord.

psst: there's a [rewrite effort](https://github.com/justinoboyle/mydiscord/tree/rewrite) going on over here.

## Credit where it's due

I quite liked [leovoel's BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord)'s lightweight implementation of stylesheets in Discord, so I modified leovoel's script to also include JavaScript support.

Because this is a fork, most of the code (and the usage section) was written by [leovoel](https://github.com/leovoel), so go show him some love.

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for anything stupid you do with this. Use common sense.

## Usage

* Install python 3+

* Open the command line - (cmd.exe AS ADMIN on Windows, Terminal on macOS/*nix)

* Open Discord

* Run the following commands:

```
python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/justinoboyle/MyDiscord/archive/master.zip
mydiscord
```

(If that fails, then run this):

```
python -m pip install -U https://github.com/justinoboyle/MyDiscord/archive/master.zip
mydiscord
```

* Have fun!

## More detailed command line usage

Just invoke the script when installed. If you don't pass the `--css` and `--js` flags, the resources
will be placed wherever the Discord app resources are found.

**NOTE:** Discord has to be running for this to work in first place.
The script works by scanning the active processes and looking for the Discord ones.

(yes, this also means you can fool the program into trying to apply this to some random program named Discord)

```
$ mydiscord --css ~/discord.css --js ~/discord.js
Found Discord Canary under /Applications/Discord Canary.app/Contents/MacOS

Done!

You may now edit your CSS in /Users/justin/discord.css,
which will be reloaded whenever it's saved.
You can also edit your JavaScript in /Users/justin/discord.js
,but you must reload (CMD/CTRL + R) Discord to re-run it

*Do not insert code that you do not understand, as it could steal your account!*

Relaunching Discord now...
$
```

Pass the `--revert` flag to remove the extracted `app.asar` (it's the `resources/app` folder)
and rename `original_app.asar` to `app.asar`. You can also do this manually if your Discord
install gets screwed up.

```
$ mydiscord --revert
Found Discord Canary under /Applications/Discord Canary.app/Contents/MacOS

Reverted changes, no more CSS hot-reload :(
$
```

You can also run it as a package - i.e. `python3 -m mydiscord` - if somehow you cannot
install it as a script that you can run from anywhere.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (no interest in compatibility with 2.x, untested on Python 3.x versions below 3.4)
- `psutil` library: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil

Normally, `pip` should install any required dependencies.

They have a Discord server as well:
